        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>My name is Carter. I am a dedicated student and rower.
            During the summers I work as a lifeguard and do landscaping.
            <br><br>
            I strive to be better every day and always am eager to learn
            something new. I am especially interested in anything that 
            involves math, sciences and computers, but I will always 
            appreciated the humanities side of learning as well.
            <br><br>
            Reach out to me via email if you want to get in touch!</p>
